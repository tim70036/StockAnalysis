## Sharp Ratio
- The ETF I select is IBUY. It corresponds generally to the price performance of the EQM Online Retail Index. This Index is a basket of companies that obtain 70% or more of revenue from online or virtual sales. The expense ratio is 0.65%.

- I set the time period of my analysis from 2020-4-9 to 2020-9-23. The reason I choose this period is that I want to see which stock has good performance after COVID crash. Then, I calculate sharp ratios from the stocks in my regular watchlist. The result shows that IBUY has the highest sharp ratio 0.312674 during this period. Also, the SP500 sharp ratio is 0.115277, so IBUY clearly outperform SP500 in this period.
